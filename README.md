Final project for Topics in Music Technology: Supercollider

The project is an interactable version of Van Gogh's "Starry Night", in which the user can turn on and off different sounds assigned to different parts of the painting. The buttons are hidden on purpose, to force the user to explore and click on parts of the painting they'd think would have sounds attached to it.

Follow the instructions in the supercollider file's comments on how to run the individual functions to create the synths, GUI, and GUI buttons.
